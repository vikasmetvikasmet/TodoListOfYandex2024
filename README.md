## What this app can do:
- **Create tasks:** Formulate and record specific tasks, defining their content and goals.
- **Prioritize:** Assess the importance of each task and rank them in order of importance to optimize the workflow.
- **Set deadlines:** Set deadlines for tasks to ensure timely completion of projects.
- **Edit tasks:** Make adjustments to the description, priority, or deadlines of tasks depending on changing circumstances or new data.
- **Track progress:** Regularly check the progress of each task, recording the results achieved and identifying possible obstacles.
- **Sort:** Organize tasks by various criteria, such as creation date, due date, priority, or status, for easy management and planning.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI — for creating a declarative user interface
- **Package Managers:**
- **Swift Package Manager:** used to integrate the CocoaLumberjack library, which provides logging capabilities.
- **CocoaPods:** used to install and manage dependencies, including SwiftLint to ensure a unified code style
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): an architectural pattern that separates business logic and user interface, which contributes to a cleaner and more maintainable code structure.
- ### Network Layer
- Implemented 6 API handles for interacting with the server, which ensures flexibility and extensibility of the application functionality.
- Using URLSession to perform network requests, which guarantees reliability and efficiency in data exchange.
- Combine — a library for handling asynchronous events and working with data streams, which allows you to easily manage reactive data streams and their changes in the user interface.
- Time debugging has been implemented to analyze network call performance, allowing us to optimize application response time.
- DispatchQueue — used to manage multithreading, allowing us to optimize the user interface and avoid blocking.
